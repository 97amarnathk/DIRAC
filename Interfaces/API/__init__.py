DIRAC - Distributed Infrastructure With Remote Agent Control

   DIRAC is a system which allows to integrate various distributed
   computing resources in a single system which is used for MC data
   production, data reprocessing and final user analysis. It consists
   of the following main subsystems:

     - Workload Management System
     - Data Management System
     - Information Services
     - Tools and utilities

   The DIRAC API provides a transparent and secure way for users to submit
   jobs to the Grid. While it may be exploited directly by users, the DIRAC API also
   serves as the interface for the Ganga Grid front-end to perform distributed user
   analysis for LHCb.  DIRAC Jobs are submitted through the API and are constructed
   using the DIRAC Job(), Step() and Module() infrastructure.
